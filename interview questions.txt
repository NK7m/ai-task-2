INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ANSWERS:

1. What is the purpose of EDA?
EDA helps understand data patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and determine feature relationships before modeling. It's crucial for informing data preprocessing and feature selection.

2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
Boxplots visually show data distribution through quartiles, highlighting median, spread, skewness, and outliers. They're excellent for comparing distributions across categories.

3. What is correlation and why is it useful?
Correlation measures linear relationships between variables (-1 to 1). It helps identify redundant features and potential predictors for the target variable.

4. How do you detect skewness in data?
Skewness can be detected by comparing mean vs median, examining histograms, or calculating skewness coefficient (positive if mean > median).

5. What is multicollinearity?
When independent variables are highly correlated, causing unstable coefficient estimates in regression models. Can be detected via correlation matrices or VIF scores.

6. What tools do you use for EDA?
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), R (ggplot2), SQL for data exploration, and Tableau for interactive visualization.

7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?
In the Titanic dataset, EDA revealed missing age values clustered in 3rd class, which could bias models if not handled properly during imputation.

8. What is the role of visualization in ML?
Visualizations help identify patterns, outliers, and relationships that might be missed in raw statistics, guiding feature engineering and model selection decisions.
